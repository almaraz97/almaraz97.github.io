## The Why
After 2 years as co-founder of Denota, I am still somehow working on the protocol. It's more of an experiment/hobby of mine at this point. I'm not sure what the practical value of it is or will be, but it's unlike anything I've seen before and combines many of my favorite aspects from other protocol's I've studied. It is a UTXO-based blockchain protocol that uses a combination of escrow and smart contracts to facilitate transactions. It is written in Solidity and is currently deployed on the Ethereum testnet. I'm not sure if it will ever be deployed on the mainnet, but I'm having fun working on it. I'm also working on a whitepaper to explain the protocol in more detail. I'll post it here when it's ready.


Why is the account model better than UTXO? That’s a question I’ve been asking myself lately. 

Everyone *feels* like there's something there but nothing quite scratches that itch.
