## My story
My name is Alex and I'm from the small city of Sarasota, Florida- best known for it's beaches and a top destination for retirees. I've always been excited by science and technology and whle I call Sarasota home I believe my purpose is making a global impact which is why I'm on this journey.

My social awkwardness and painful self-awareness of this fact in grade-school led me to the world of self-improvement at a young age so when I attended the University of Florida psychology seemed like the natural next step. As I reached my junior year, however, it became obvious I neither wanted to be a therapist nor an academic. 

I briefly began studying to become an actuary and, while taking on more math/statistics courses, I met a now friend who recommended I work with him on a machine learning research grant. I began learning Python and more ML-based math and a few months later I began working building custom audio generation models.

During that time I began experimenting with creating websites, and starting a consulting company with that same friend and another mutual one where we got a client who needed an IoT device. I was recommended to another professor once the project wrapped up since I did well and he offered me a research position analyzing traffic patterns in the University area. 

For reasons I don't remember, I got really into crypto and decided to go alone to ETH Denver in 2020 where I met my future co-founders on the first day. We stayed in touch in the months after and while going through a break-up I decided to visit one of them in New York City- which brought me hope and helped me feel like I was progressing despite feeling so lost and unsure of what was next.

My co-founder told me his idea of a reversible crypto payment which stuck with me and I began working on it as a side project. The three of us went to Consensys in Austin and what felt like the starts aligning we began working on Denota (then Cheq) more seriously. We rented an apartment in Miami and for a month spent nearly every waking hour working on the project.

7 months later and my savings nearly gone, we secured funding for a respectible amount given the circumstances. The next year and a half was filled with lessons in perserverence, patience, and enduring difficulty, uncertainty, and self-doubt. Which deserves it's own blog post.

Now I'm following my sense of what is interesting which is mainly in the web3, privacy, and AI spaces. This page will be updated further.
